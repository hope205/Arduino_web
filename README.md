# Arduino_web

This project is a really cool project that enables you to visualize your sensor readings in form of a graph on your webpage.

I made use of a nodemcu which is responsible for sending the data to mysql database and and a webpage which uses php to query the values from the database and displays them on the webpage.

Make sure you create the correct sql database in your local system, you can also make use of an online server or a local one like xampp.


Have fun tryinh it out.

This is what it looks like when you eventaully get it to work
